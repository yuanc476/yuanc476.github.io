			<p>"Anyone whose been in an unsafe situation knows the feeling: the creeping sensation of dread and the worry that you won't be able to get help fast enough, should you need it.</p>

			<p>While smartphones make it easier than ever before to dial 911, and smartwatches include features like SOS, sometimes you just want the people in your life to know where you are before something bad happens.</p> 

			<p>Enter Nimb: a panic button disguised as costume jewelry.</p>

			<p>The Nimb ring is designed to be a quick, subtle way to send your location to anyone from friends to emergency personnel to alert them that you're in a dangerous situation."</p>

			<p>While this ring is mainly advertised as an assault prevention device, it can also be an elegant emergency button for the elderly, who do not always want to wear emergency watches and bracelets.</p>
