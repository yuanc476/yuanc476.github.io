		<p>Jackson Hughes, a scientific software developer in Georgia, decided nearly 10 years ago it was time his grandparents learned to use e-mail to keep in touch with their 4 children and 11 grandchildren scattered about the country. It might have worked if computer screens weren’t so cluttered with tiny fonts and distracting pictures. And there were all those unfamiliar concepts: cursor, mouse, menu, icon, browser, folder, file, scroll, download, upload, right-click, double-click.</p>

		<p>Mr. Hughes realized the e-mail project had reached a dead end when his grandfather, Paw Paw, turned his keyboard into a letter holder and designated the row between 1234 and QWER for bills.</p>

		<p>Not one to shy away from obstacles, Mr. Hughes got together with his business partner, Ali Syed, to design an e-mail system that no senior could resist: no logins or links, no ad boxes or news flashes, no pokes or Twitters — only personal e-mail messages and photographs, with a caregiver making sure that everything is running smoothly.</p>

		<p>They named it PawPawMail and created a Web site, pawpawmail.com. Anyone can use the software for $5 a month and run it on virtually any P.C. or Mac, including old clunkers gathering dust in the back of closets.</p>

		<p>The market is far from glutted with senior software, but an Internet search for “e-mail for seniors” or “elderly e-mail” leads to a variety of applications and a few devices designed to simplify and enhance the e-mail experience. People with arthritic fingers and failing eyesight can find voice-activated programs and supersize keypads; those who do not have access to computers can receive e-mail messages via devices hooked up to fax lines. The cost of senior e-mail software usually runs around $10 a month, and the devices range from $20 to $120.</p>

		<p>What distinguishes PawPawMail from other programs is that it is a managed system aimed at caregivers as well as seniors. “PawPawMail is built entirely around the idea of two users,” Mr. Hughes said in a recent e-mail message. “The senior user who actually uses the e-mail account, and the caretaker/manager who helps set the senior up, gets his or her address book going, and screens mail from unknown sources to prevent contact from all the ridiculous number of scams that are directed at seniors.”</p>

		<p>Rebekah Bryant, a Web developer and communication specialist in South Dakota, was hesitant to encourage her parents, both in their late 70s and living in West Virginia, to make good on a long-standing promise to buy a computer and “get the Internet.” Ms. Bryant thought it was even more of a lost cause when her mother asked for her fax number so she could send an e-mail message and then spelled out “d-o-t” in an e-mail address.</p>

		<p>It didn’t get much better when Ms. Bryant tried giving her parents basic computer lessons over the phone. After many calls, her father reported that it took him three days to close a window and that he still didn’t know how to make an @ symbol appear on the screen.</p>

		<p>Given her parents’ struggles, Ms. Bryant said, she was “ecstatic” when she stumbled on PawPawMail, which had been a topic in computer chat rooms. (It turns out that computer experts have as much trouble as the rest of us figuring out how to get elderly family members to use e-mail.) As soon as she set up the PawPawMail management system on her end, the window-closing and address-writing problems vanished on her parents’ end. All that was left for them to do was read and write their messages and look at the photographs people sent them.</p>

		<p>E-mail can be a touchy subject not only for seniors who have never tried it, but also for those who are old hands. If some of my recent e-mail is any indication, there are many older people who can get rather testy when someone younger assumes they don’t use e-mail just because they are older. And when it comes to their contemporaries, older people who do use e-mail pity those who don’t.</p>

		<p>Mary McCurdy, who is 92 and lives alone in a small town in Ohio, boasts 75 names in her address book and 10 to 12 incoming messages every day. “We all just try to keep it funny. … It’s like chatting,” she said in a recent message. Fewer than half of her friends use e-mail, so she prints out the “funniest things” she gets and takes them to group luncheons and other social occasions.</p>

		<p>E-mail can have an emotional component as well. Unlike phone calls, which are transitory, e-mail messages can be saved and treasured.When his Aunt Hilda died at age 91, Robert Greenman, author of “Words That Make a Difference” and “More Words That Make a Difference,” eulogized her not in his words but with excerpts of the charming, impassioned messages she had sent over the years.</p>

		<p>Caregivers should keep technology in mind when the time comes to look for retirement communities and assisted living quarters. In a blog called Aging in Place Technology Watch, www.ageinplacetech.com, Laurie Orlov advises seniors and caregivers to check out the availability and cost of wireless connections, in-room computers, touch screens, shared computer libraries and computer education programs. While some retirement facilities and eldercare centers have excellent online services and education programs, many are woefully behind the times.</p>

		<p>Mr. Hughes said his grandfather was one of the lucky ones: his assisted living facility had computers in every wing and only a few “computer hogs” in residence. But he got to enjoy the new e-mail system that bears his name for only about a month and a half. Paw Paw died on April 23 at the age of 94.</p>
