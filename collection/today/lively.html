		<p>NEW YORK—Before she passed away a couple of years ago, my mom reluctantly wore one of those "I've fallen and can't get up" emergency pendants. Wearing such a necklace, as one older person put it, is like entering the departure lounge of life.</p>

		<p>Sadly I'll never know if my mom would have taken more kindly to the Lively Smart Emergency Response watch that I've been looking at. Suffice it to say wearing something on her wrist would have felt less conspicuous.</p>

		<p>Given the broad interest in high tech watches nowadays—and the much-anticipated arrival of the Apple Watch smart watch in April--it shouldn't surprise anyone that a company would gear a safety-oriented watch towards the aging population.</p>

		<p>That company is Lively out of San Francisco, which already produces a home monitoring kit with a wireless hub and sensors that you can stick on refrigerator doors, pillboxes and other items around the home, all to help monitor a senior's activity.</p>

		<p>Now the kit comes with a watch.</p>

		<p>Lively is targeting the 100 million people age 50-plus in the U.S. who like my mom did want to live alone as long as possible. Lively is also going after the more than 43 million caregivers who want to help keep loved ones safe and healthy.</p>

		<p>The Lively kit with the watch includes the hub and four sensors, one designated for the refrigerator, two for pillboxes, and one for a custom location, maybe a bathroom door. That way notifications are delivered, if, say, mom forgets to take her medicine.</p>

		<p>The watch itself is waterproof—I showered testing it—and it includes a rudimentary accelerometer-based step counter.</p>

		<p>What mostly sets it apart though is the orange button on the side that when pressed reaches Lively's 24/7 emergency center, the folks who can summon 911 and/or contact designated relatives, neighbors or caregivers. One big caveat: the watch must be within 1500 feet of the hub to reach the call center.</p>

		<p>For now when you're out of range, the watch reminds the person to call 911 directly, a recommendation that in my experience only showed up after several minutes, kind of defeating the purpose.</p>

		<p>Come spring Lively plans to let you pair the watch with an iPhone or Android smartphone to cover emergencies when you're out and about. So if you press the orange button the phone would dial out for help.</p>

		<p>Fortunately, I got fast callbacks whenever I pressed the orange button in my house. (I set it up so as not to burden 911 with false alarms). You have to exert a little bit of force to press the button, but it's not out of the question that a senior might push it accidentally.</p>

		<p>Lively co-founder David Glickman say 95% of falls where help is not otherwise available occur in the home. In the works is a clip-on accessory that for an added fee automatically detects falls and contacts the call center.</p>

		<p>The hub in the home is cellular based and doesn't require an Internet connection. Back when my mom pushed her pendant, a live voice would speak to her over an intercom. That's not the case with Lively—a senior pushing the button would have to wait for a callback or for emergency responders to show up.</p>

		<p>Lively charges $49.95 for the kit, plus $34.95 per month (first month free) for service. Cheaper options are available if you pay on an annual basis.</p>

		<p>The orange button is in fact the only button on the watch. Lively is trying to keep things simple. In that sense this isn't a full-featured smart watch or even a fitness watch. There are no on-watch apps. It doesn't monitor sleep or measure heart rate or other vitals. The step counter isn't the most accurate. What is being measured is the movement of the watch, so my steps tally climbed even when I lay in bed.</p>

		<p>You can tap the face of the watch to toggle from a clock view to a steps view.</p>

		<p>I wouldn't say the watch is the epitome of fashion but it's not geeky looking either and is comfortable to wear. The 1.97-inch display is monochrome. You can order the watch in black or white and swap its rubbery watchband for another standard band.</p>

		<p>Lively's attractive sensors and hub comes out of Bould Design, whose clients include Google-owned Nest Labs.</p>

		<p>You can also display an analog or digital clock but can't make that change on the watch face directly—instead you apply the setting on the Lively website and wait the change to register on the watch, which can take an awfully long time.</p>

		<p>From the Lively website or an app on your phone, you can also view a dashboard of activities and apply other settings. And family members can upload pictures creating a so-called LivelyGram that is delivered monthly to the senior by postal mail.</p>

		<p>No charging is required since the watch uses a standard watch battery that should last months. Alas the battery cover on the back—which must be flush to protect the waterproofing—is clumsy to put on. If I fumbled with it I can only imagine the kind of difficulty my mom would have had. Lively is tweaking the design.</p>

		<p>That's one way that Lively can improve. But if Lively helps save a loved one's life you're more than happy to overlook its imperfections.</p>
