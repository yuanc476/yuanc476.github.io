		<p>Studies have shown that high frequency intensive nerve stimulation is an effective option for treating various types of chronic pain.</p>
		<p>Quell is wearable technology that uses intensive nerve stimulation to provide widespread pain relief. It is designed to be worn on the calf, regardless of where you are experiencing pain, and stimulates your nerves in a way that is powerful enough to trigger the release of your body’s natural pain blockers. Pain is blocked at the spinal cord, which helps you feel widespread relief from your pain, not just relief in a specific part of your body.</p>
		<p>Using Quell doesn’t eliminate the cause of your pain, and Quell is not a cure, but it can “turn down the volume” so you can reclaim your life. Quell is FDA cleared for 24/7 use and is user-friendly. You can easily wear it under your clothes. There is an optional smartphone app that you can use to control the device and track your therapy and your sleep.</p>
