		<b>Pendant that automatically alerts caregivers if you fall</b>

		<p>Encouraging independence with peace of mind – for both the individual and their family – is the thinking behind the Philips HomeSafe Auto Alert System, which uses a waterproof help button pendant that automatically triggers the alarm if it senses a fall, but can also be user activated.</p>

		<p>Once activated, this sets up two-way communication with the helpline via a speakerphone. A complementary system called CareSensus will also soon be available that uses movement sensors around the home to track activity and behaviour, including eating, sleeping, and entering and leaving the house. Smart analytics identify any abnormal behaviour and care staff can be contacted for video calls via a tablet interface.</p>

		<b>Pill bottle that senses when it’s used</b>

		<p>Half of medication for chronic illness is not taken as prescribed. It is a problem that costs the NHS more than £150 million a year and risks patients’ health – but has proved hard to address, since complex regimes of pills can be a challenge for some patients, particularly the very elderly.</p>

		<p>“We all know that medicines only work when you remember to take the right amount of them at the right time,” says Dr Cochrane. “So ‘smart’ or connected medicine dispensers, which send reminders to your phone when you’re meant to be taking your pills, can calculate how many you’ve taken and share this information with your doctor, could have a really positive impact on efficacy.” This will benefit caregivers – but also worried relatives, wanting to know that Dad or Grandma is taking the pills they need.</p>

		<b>Carebot that helps people stay independent</b>

		<p>With an ageing population, it is becoming increasingly important to devise ways of ensuring that older people can live safely and independently for as long as possible. One of the biggest issues is often lack of mobility, with elderly people becoming unable to get themselves out of bed or move around.</p>

		<p>In Japan, where 20 per cent of the population is over 65, they are looking to carebots – robots specifically designed to assist elderly people – to shoulder the burden. These carebots can range from life-sized humanoid bots that can lift patients, or help them walk, to furniture that transforms from a bed to a wheelchair, and mobile servants that can fetch and carry things from one room to another.</p>
