		<p>This wearable device, which is strapped to a patient's arm and continuously collects data, will be trialled by two UK hospitals in the coming months.</p>

		<p>Created by the Scotland-based snap40 the device alerts doctors and nurses to when a patient's vital signs indicate a further health risk may occur.</p>

		<p>"The device is warn on the upper arm and it monitors six different vital signs: heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturations, temperature, emotion, posture and changes in the blood pressure," Chris McCann, snap40’s CEO and founder, tells WIRED. His firm has just been awarded £1 million healthcare development contract from NHS England's Small Business Research Initiative.</p>

		<p>Beginning in April and May, the firm will conduct trials on up to 500 patients at the Victoria Hospital, run by NHS Fife, and the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, controlled by NHS Lothian.</p>

		<p>The snap40 device works by monitoring patients using multiple sensors. "The device transmits raw signal from six different sensors then we do a significant amount of computation in our back-end to say this is a vital sign," says McCann, who previously founded a pre-moderated social network for children. "All told, we transmit about 15,000 data points off the device every 30 seconds."</p>

		<p>Once the data has been collected, the firm's machine learning algorithms analyse the raw data and turn it into a patient's vital signs. The device can then send alerts to medical staff when necessary.</p>

		<p>It has a battery-life of two days, wireless charging and transmits patient information by Wi-Fi twice a minute. McCann says the device will only be worn by people admitted to the hospital, but not by anyone under the age of 16.</p>

		<p>"Essentially the device itself measures parameters that indicate if the patient is stable or not," says Alex Baldacchino, NHS Fife research and development director. The snap40 product has already been piloted within the organisation, he adds.</p>

		<p>According to Baldacchino, clinical environments "are not that relaxed around novel technologies" but initial research from the pilot was "very encouraging" and the new tests will prove its feasibility on patients. "This will give an early warning to a situation if it actually happens, without that time being wasted by nurses taking those measurements," Baldacchino continues.</p>

		<p>The device is one of a number of approaches being taken by different branches of the NHS, and the medical profession generally, to improve patient care. A wearable patch developed by VitalConnect sends vital signs to caregivers and has already been tested in Europe and the USA.</p>

		<p>In the UK, Manchester-based startup eLucid mHealth was awarded test contracts with the NHS to provide patients with medications in a "secure, intelligent container". The natural language AI company Babylon is due to begin a trial in North London where 1.2 million people will receive medical advice from a chatbot.</p>

		<p>Baldacchino explains the NHS has to test new technologies to save time and money. The message was echoed by Mahiben Maruthappu, the co-founder of the NHS Innovation Accelerator at WIRED Health in 2016.</p>

		<p>"A lot of time is spent to monitor and prevent a situation that might never happen," says Baldacchino of the snap40 wearable. "This will give an early warning to a situation if it actually happens, without that time being wasted by nurses taking those measurements."</p>

		<p>For McCann, the product is "100 per cent not about trying to replace" doctors. He says it is to assist them so they can use their time better. It is hoped the two trials, which will be completed by the end of the year, will be a starting point for expansion in the UK and internationally.</p>

		<p>"For us, these two implementations are not all we're doing this year," says McCann. "We hope to be in a further seven hospitals – six of them in the UK and one in the US – by the end of this year."</p>
