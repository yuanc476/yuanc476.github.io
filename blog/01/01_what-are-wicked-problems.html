		<p>Wicked problems are issues so ingrained and important to our lives that I was surprised to learn of the term so late. A wicked problem refers to “a social or cultural problem that is difficult or impossible to solve for as many as four reasons: incomplete or contradictory knowledge, the number of people and opinions involved, the large economic burden, and the interconnected nature of these problems with other problems”(1). These problems are so massive that we usually ignore them or do not act on them, assuming that more powerful people and teams are working on it (such as politicians). We do, however, through design and hard work, have a say in how the future of these problems unfold.</p>

		<p>The term was first used by Horst Rittel and Melvin Webber in “Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning”, who described “wicked problems” with the following characteristics: (2) </p>

		<p>“There is no definitive formulation of a wicked problem.” Unlike typical problems, the information needed to approach a wicked problem depends on the angle the designers take. “The process of formulating the problem and of conceiving a solution (or re-solution) are identical, since every specification of the problem is a specification of the direction in which a treatment is considered.” The space in which the wicked problem takes place is so wide across so many other problems that it is very difficult to narrow it down to a solution.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>“Wicked problems have no stopping rule.” There are so many causes and relations to other problems that designers cannot reach a final, best solution. More research and effort could always bring a better solution, so projects on wicked problems usually end due to restrictions like time or resources.</li>
			<li>“Solutions to wicked problems are not true-or-false, but good-or-bad.”</li>
			<li>“There is no immediate and no ultimate test of a solution to a wicked problem.” Solutions to wicked problems have immeasurable consequences that may bring forth a wave of negative effects before being able to improve the situation.</li>
			<li>“Every solution to a wicked problem is a “one-shot operation”; because there is no opportunity to learn by trial-and-error, every attempt counts significantly.” Every launch of a solution will have a considerable impact that will affect many people, and those effects will not be able to be taken back.</li>
			<li>“Wicked problems do not have an enumerable (or an exhaustively describable) set of potential solutions, nor is there a well-described set of permissible operations that may be incorporated into the plan.” There are very little to no rules or limitations to what the solutions can be.</li>
			<li>“Every wicked problem is essentially unique.” Solutions to similar aspects of different wicked problems are not necessarily transferrable because many other things influence the issues.</li>
			<li>“Every wicked problem can be considered to be a symptom of another problem.”</li>
			<li>“The existence of a discrepancy representing a wicked problem can be explained in numerous ways. The choice of explanation determines the nature of the problem’s resolution.”</li>
			<li>“The planner has no right to be wrong.”</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Why should I care about the concept of “wicked problems”?</p>

		<p>I started design school not totally sure of what I wanted to do. All I knew was that I wanted to learn and I wanted to help. School, so far, has taught me two things among many others. One, that certainty is not necessarily needed or desired; and two, that design has a much bigger impact on the world than I had previously thought. It was in school, during a sustainability class, that I was first introduced to the term “wicked problems”. At first, the fact that these seemingly unsolvable problems had a name only made them more real and immovable in my mind. It made me feel more helpless and hopeless about the world. But having a name and definition for these difficult issues helped me think of them in clearer ways. It is a crucial step to approaching them.</p>
