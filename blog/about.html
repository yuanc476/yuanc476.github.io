		<p>“Wicked Problems: Problems Worth Solving” by John Kolko is a handbook written to guide designers and teachers to “design for impact”. First coined by Berkeley professors Horst Rittel and Melvin Webber, “wicked problems” is a term used to describe issues with seemingly no good solutions due to “incomplete or contradictory knowledge, the number of people and opinions involved, the large economic burden, and the interconnected nature of these problems with other problems.” Kolko claims that these problems cannot be “fixed" but that design can help mitigate them.  This blog lays out the definition and implications of wicked problems, focuses on climate change, and explores solutions. It is a quest to understand wicked problems and develop a more concrete goal for designers and students like me.</p>
