<div class="title"><h3>Issues and solutions</h3></div>
<div class="text">
	<p>What I need is to be educated but also have hope. I often hear about issues and events that make me feel helpless, but I also frequently know too little about those things. While a google search can help solve that, I can only research what I have heard about. Other things like time limitations, embarrassment, or even laziness (which I am often guilty of) can prevent people from learning more. Creating a space for people who want to know more but do not know where to start can help people like me to understand the world better. It could also be a place for people to debate or share more information (the information would have to be double checked).</p>

	<p>Important historical and current events and figures could be covered (although there might need to be some limitations since this topic is so broad). I realize that I do not know a lot of the things I should know, such as current conflicts; and I know that I am not alone. Social and environmental issues can also be discussed.</p>

	<p>I am a rather pessimistic person, and while learning about events and conflicts is necessary, I need to also remember that we are not completely helpless. Having content about positive news or historical events can give people hope and empower them. For example, acts of protest that have had effect on the outcome of events. Another example is robots that have been developed that help with pollination (since the bee population is rapidly declining).</p>
