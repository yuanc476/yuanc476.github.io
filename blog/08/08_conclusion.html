		<p>It’s easy to feel discouraged by the scale of the task we have. But we can and do have a role in the way the future will be shaped. It can be through several things.</p>

		<p>As designers, we must be aware of the impact we have on society. What values and information do we want to support, elaborate on, and spread. As an entity, we have the influence to change many people’s perceptions and points of view, and we should not let that be misused or go to waste. We need to use our skills for the change we want and the causes we support, not just for furthering consumption and strengthening the status quo. This can be done in multiple ways: directly designing to solve certain issues, teaching a sustainable (design) mindset, spreading information about climate change in new ways to keep people interested and alert.</p>

		<p>There is also a relatively new branch of design called speculative design. Its aim is not to produce new, usable products or systems, but rather to help us think, examine, and question our beliefs and assumptions. These design show worlds that could be, no matter how outlandish the concept. But in doing so, they make us wonder about the world these designs would exist in, and whether we want that world for us in the future. What are the values in that imagined society? How is it similar and how is it different from our present or the future we expect to happen? If we do not like it, how can we help to prevent that world from happening? If it’s a society we would like to see, how do we make it a reality?</p>

		<p>As civilians, there are many things we can to about the issue of climate change as well. We must be politically active to ensure that the government that represents us reflects our values and needs. We must hold politicians accountable for their impact or lack of impact on climate change, because it is a pressing issue that cannot be ignored.</p>

		<p>Our time is very valuable. We can do so much with it, and letting it go to waste would be a shame. Volunteering, donating, educating, advocating, these are all words we should look into and include into our lives when possible.</p>

		<p>We cannot expect to solve climate change single-handedly. It is important to remember that in order not to get discouraged. We must trust that other people are doing their part in their best way, and that our combined efforts can will a change. Change will take time, which is a little scary when it comes to such a pressing issue, but change will happen if we make it. Each one of us must take the time to educate ourselves on climate change (or other wicked problems), determine what we can do to help, and do it. It will be rewarding.</p>
