		<p>According to <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/solutions/adaptation-mitigation/">NASA</a>,  “Responding to climate change involves two possible approaches: reducing and stabilizing the levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (“mitigation”) and/or adapting to the climate change already in the pipeline (“adaptation”).”</p>

		<p>Many doubt the validity of climate scientists, and this doubt makes it very difficult to create change at all levels. Education is thus vital to solving the problem of climate change.</p>

		<p>Education can help in both these approaches. In order to face the problem of climate change, we need to change the way we think. Teaching the principles of sustainability, renewability, and reusability from a young age could shape the mindset of future generations, making it easier to change systems that are already in place (such as consumerism or the use of fossil fuels). Education also allows for new and better continued research, which is key to new knowledge. Education could also play a role in adaptation. One of the symptoms of climate change is extreme weather events and disasters. Educated people have been shown to be able to respond to disasters better and faster, and are able to recover quicker as well. (https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/issues/article.php/6476)</p>

		<p>In “Combating Climate Change Through Quality Education”, Allison Anderson gives several recommendations:
			<ul>
				<li>Expand the climate change agenda to include education as a tool in adaptation and mitigation strategies.</li>
				<li>Promote an Education for Sustainable Development agenda that incorporates disaster risk reduction, quality learning, and environmental and climate change education.</li>
				<li>Finance education to combat climate change.</li>
				<li>Strengthen the knowledge base, information sharing and networking.</li>

			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>Most of these solutions involve decisions that are made at levels the usual citizen has no access to. Civiced.org gives several ways citizens can influence politics:
			<ul>
				<li>voting in local, state, and national elections</li>
				<li>participating in a political discussion</li>
				<li>trying to persuade someone to vote a certain way</li>
				<li>signing a petition</li>
				<li>wearing a button or putting a sticker on the car</li>
				<li>writing letters to elected representatives</li>
				<li>contributing money to a party or candidate</li>
				<li>attending meetings to gain information, discuss issues, or lend support
				campaigning for a candidate</li>
				<li>lobbying for laws that are of special interest</li>
				<li>demonstrating through marches, boycotts, sit-ins, or other forms of protest</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>However, these are not the only solutions. As citizens or non-citizens, we can also take direct action. We can volunteer to teach about climate change and sustainability in local communities or inform those around us about lifestyles with smaller carbon footprints. We can also donate to or participate in organizations such as the Alliance for Climate Education.</p>

		<p>As designers, we can think of new ways to spread information and reach new audiences. Whether it is through websites, apps, social media, books, magazines, posters, or campaigns, messages and knowledge can be passed on in increasingly effective ways. Educational programs can also be designed, including experiences, games, and other activities.</p>
