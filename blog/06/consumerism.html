	<div id="text">
		<p>Our consumerist culture is a very big obstacle in our quest to reduce climate change. The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines “consumerism” as “the theory that an increasing consumption of goods is economically desirable; also :  a preoccupation with and an inclination toward the buying of consumer goods”. But consuming at the rate we do now is absolutely not sustainable. We are using more resources than we can afford to without replacing them. We are using un-renewable energies in quantities that will lead us to very hostile climate change.</p>

		<p>The systems we currently have in place are very hard to change. Large, powerful corporations who contribute to consumerism do not want to lose money. Selling less means less income and a lower GDP, which is not in the interest of populations. Changing factories and infrastructure to use renewable energy and recycled materials is very costly. Despite all these drawbacks, the end of consumerist culture is vital to our survival as a species. It is a price we have to pay in order to have a shot at a future on Earth.</p>

		<p>In order for populations to be willing to make those changes, a change in mindsets needs to happen. The urgency of the situation must be communicated. This can be done in several ways. Education can shape new generations to prioritize the issue of climate change and the environment. It can also spread knowledge about it and lead to new discoveries and solutions. With this knowledge, people can make more informed decisions about what they consume and support, and how they use materials and energy. Education is one of the only ways that a large part of the population can be brought to have the same mindset. With each new generation, the hope is that people are increasingly aware of their ecological impact and strive to reduce it.</p>

		<p>We must:
			<ul>
				<li>Reduce the amount of products we consume</li>
				<li>Stop the obession with the new</li>
				<li>Reuse products and materials</li>
				<li>Replace the resources we use from nature</li>
				<li>Reduce waste (ex. Energy, plastic, water)</li>
				<li>End the practice of planned obsolescence</li>
				<li>Replace fossil fuels and coal with renewable energy</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>As individuals, we can play our parts. We can reduce the amount of products we purchase. We can be mindful of our energy sources if we can afford it.</p>
