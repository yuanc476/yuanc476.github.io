	<div class="text">
		<p>The South China Sea is home to territorial tensions and potential conflicts between China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei. The six countries all lay contradictory claims to islands (mainly the Paracels and the Spratlys island chains) and maritime territory.</p>

		<p>China claims that the islands have been considered a part of China for centuries, and provided a map in 1947 showing the islands as part of Chinese territory. Taiwan's claims are the same, since Taiwan's current government used to be mainland China's government. Acording to critics, the claims are not specific enough and has no coordinates.</p>

		<p>Vietnam strongly disagrees with China's claims, saying that Vietnam had been ruling over the Paracels and Spratlys for the past four centuries.</p>

		<p>The Philippines' claim rests on its geographical position: it is very close to the islands.</p>

		<p>Part of the disputed territory is in Malaysia and Brunei's economic exclusion zones, and are thus claimed by the respective governments.</p>

		<p>Although the islands are mostly uninhabited, estimations of natural resources in the South China Sea are very high: 11 billions of oil and 190 cubic feet of gas. The area is also on a trade route for ships. <a href="http://www.cfr.org/global/global-conflict-tracker/p32137#!/conflict/territorial-disputes-in-the-south-china-sea">(1)</a></p>

		<p>Tensions have flared up in recent years. In 2012, China and the Philippines had a military standoff. Anti-China protests started in Vietnam after unverified claims about Chinese sabotage of Vietnamese exploration operations were made. In 2013, the Philippines took the conflict to the UN Convention on the Laws of the Sea, which backed the Philippines in 2016. However, China did not recognize the outcome of the procceedings. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-13748349"></a>(2) Many countries call for the issue to be resolved by ASEAN (the Association of South East Asian Nations), but China is opposed to it and the other participating countries are divided on the topic.</p>

		<p>Tensions have further increased when it was found that China was creating artificial islands and constructing infrastructure on the Paracel and Spratly Island chains, reclaiming more than 2900 acres of land since 2013. The constructions increase China's power projection considerably. <a href="http://www.cfr.org/asia-and-pacific/chinas-maritime-disputes/p31345#!/?cid=otr-marketing_use-china_sea_InfoGuide">(3)</a></p>

		<p>Since the South China Sea is an active area for ships, there is a high chance that a miscalculation could spark off an armed conflict between the countries. The USA could also be pulled into the conflict due to its military ties and obligations to the Philippines and Japan.</p>
