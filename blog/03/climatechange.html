	<div id="title"><h2>A WICKED PROBLEM: CLIMATE CHANGE</h2></div>
	<div id="text">
		<p>The first time I learned about wicked problems, it was in the context of sustainability and the environment. My mind therefore goes there automatically when I think of wicked problems. But how is pollution and climate change a wicked problem?</p>

		<p>As discussed in the first post, there are ten characteristics of a wicked problem. Let’s see how they translate in the case of climate change.</p>

		<ul>

			<li>“There is no definitive formulation of a wicked problem.” There is no single understanding or definition of climate change. Some do not even believe in it. It is difficult to study since it is currently happening over long periods of time. Our understanding of climate change and its effects are constantly shifting.
			“Wicked problems have no stopping rule.” There is always another area of industry, politics, lifestyle, etc. that can be improved on to reduce our negative impact on the planet.</li>

			<li>“Solutions to wicked problems are not true-or-false, but good-or-bad.” There are no wrong solutions, only solutions that work better or worse to solve the problem. For example, a campaign to reduce the production and use of plastic bags can be well or ill-suited for its circumstances, and work better or worse. It is not wrong or right.</li>

			<li>“There is no immediate and no ultimate test of a solution to a wicked problem.” The consequences of solutions are so wide and difficult to predict that we cannot test them the way we could test a product. We cannot test the impact of a law reform concerning the use of fossil fuels, for example.</li>

			<li>“Every solution to a wicked problem is a “one-shot operation”; because there is no opportunity to learn by trial-and-error, every attempt counts significantly.” There is not enough time in the case of climate change to have the luxury to make mistakes. The consequences are potentially enormous on the environment, societies, politics, etc.</li>

			<li>“Wicked problems do not have an enumerable (or an exhaustively describable) set of potential solutions, nor is there a well-described set of permissible operations that may be incorporated into the plan.” We do not have a protocol to deal with climate change since this is an issue that we have tried to address only recently.</li>

			<li>“Every wicked problem is essentially unique.” The general problem of climate change is a combination of many smaller wicked problems. But a solution to cut down CO2 emissions in China could not work in the USA.
			“Every wicked problem can be considered to be a symptom of another problem.” Climate change can be considered a symptom of corporate greed, disregard for nature, poverty, or lack of education on the topic.</li>

			<li>“The existence of a discrepancy representing a wicked problem can be explained in numerous ways. The choice of explanation determines the nature of the problem’s resolution.” Someone who explains climate change through the industrial system will have very different solutions to someone who views it through education problems.</li>

			<li>“The planner has no right to be wrong.” Changes in legislation or education would have heavy consequences that cannot be taken back.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Many things play a part in the problem of climate change. Poverty, education, politics, industrialism, consumerism, habits, culture, and more. All these areas need attention and are also different points of views that can be addressed.
