	<div id="title"><h2>POVERTY</h2></div>

	<div id="text">
		<p>Poverty is a factor that influences many of the other factors. Poverty affects peopleâ€™s access to information and education. It brings priorities that often do not include political participation or activism, so people living in poverty often do not have a voice. The products they purchase are more likely to be cheaper, which often involved unsustainable practices. These products may have a short life, causing people to buy more and create more waste.</p>

		<p>From a wider angle, poverty affects the way populations function. Unsustainable practices are used more because they are often cheaper since they are set systems that have been tried and established for longer periods of time. For example, fossil fuels are more likely to be used for transportation in poor areas, whereas more affluent places may have electric vehicles. A country or area would need to a large amount of funds to change the infrastructure for vehicle fuel (gas stations, etc.), funds which could be used to improve on more immediately pressing issues.</p>

		<p>Confronting this influence on climate change is very challenging. We do not have a solution to poverty. However, we can do small actions that can build up over time. Volunteering is what comes immediately to mind: it requires no money, just time, effort, and goodwill. The funds it does require are often provided by donations.</p>

		<p>So what can we do? If we have the means and the time, we can volunteer our time, skills, and resources in so many ways. We can volunteer at shelters, food programs, or child care programs. We can donate extra food and unneeded items. We can teach and tutor students, and create community support for those in need. Anything that alleviates some of the stress of poverty helps. Donations and volunteering can also apply beyond the local community.</p> 

		<p>Designers can create programs and systems that are more inclusive of the usually marginalized populations. On a smaller scale, individual designers such as graphic designers can work with non-profits to spread mission statements, attract more people to volunteering, and support causes.</p>

		<p>These solutions are on a very small scale, but they can make a difference. Especially if many participate. However, for more significant results, the changes need to be systematic.</p>
