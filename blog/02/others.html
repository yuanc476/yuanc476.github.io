		<p>It is easy to feel discouraged when faced with one or multiple wicked problems. I definitely was when I first learned about them. But a lecture by Clive Dilnot in my Introduction to Design Studies class helped me regain some hope. In “Reasons to Be Cheerful, 1, 2, 3 (Or Why the Artificial May Yet Save Us)”, Dilnot discusses the topic of the artificial in our world. It has not always been the case, but since the 2000’s on, the artificial has encompassed everything in our world. The places we live, the objects we use, and even the food we eat is artificial (our food is a result of selective breeding over our existence as a human race). We are entirely, reliant on the artificial. There is therefore no reason things should be and should stay the way they are. The systems, products, and spaces we experience are artificial and we thus have the power to change them. We have the responsibility to change, design, and create our artificial world to be the best it can be for each different situation. It is a never-ending process because we will never reach an ideal world: there will always be something we can improve on or change to keep it relevant. This fact is not something to be sad about. We should instead be motivated, knowing that there is always a better way and that we can reach it.</p>

		<p>A question he asked was “why design”? He explained that design is the way we change our environment to suit us. It does not end with a product or space, it ends with the impact it has on our world. We should therefore be aware of the marks we leave, whether it is through a new solution to a problem, an impact on a population, or the transformation of materials and resources. When we create something, it is often by taking materials and resources and creating a product and waste, and experiences alongside them. But all of it, including the waste, are things that stay within our system (of the world). We can never “throw things away” because they remain inside our system. We just change them and move them.</p>

		<p>When we remove the idea of the “outside”, design suddenly becomes a more serious and impactful of a topic. Design is the expression of our existence and our desire to live the way we want to, and in an artificial world, design is everything. Design affects the way materials and resources are used, the way living things experience life, and whether or not the human race has a future. This shift in mindset can help everyone direct their ideas, research, ethics, and work towards a better future for all.</p>
