	<div class="title"><h2>Design for the Elderly: Currently Available</h2></div>
	<div class="text">
		<p>This week, I looked more into what is currently available to older populations. Multiple applications have been created to help people in their old age, for example:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Park'n'Forget: lets users record where they parked their car.</li>
			<li>Pillboxie: reminds users to take the right medicine on time.</li>
			<li>Silver Surf: facilitates app use by allowing users to zoom in, increase contrast, font size, button size, etc.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I also found some products that were popular with the elderly that surprised me. For example, the Nintendo Wii is a game console that is accessible to the elderly due to the smaller movements required. Bowling on Wii Sports is much more gentle than bowling in real life. VR can also be appealing, since it offers realistic sights to people who may no longer be able to physically access those places.</p>
		<p>Other pieces of technology, such as sensors, can alert caretakers or family about falls. "Granny Pods" are another example that are gaining popularity in the USA. These are small "shacks" for the elderly to live in that are placed in the family's garden as an alternative to retirement or care homes. Devices like Quell can help with chronic pain.</p>
