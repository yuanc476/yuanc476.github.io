			<p>BIOGRAPHY</p>
			<p>Joseph Albers was born March 19th, 1888, in Bottrop, Germany. He attended Konigliche Kunstschule in Berlin from 1913 to 1915, whereby he was certified to teach arts. Similarly, at the age of 32 in 1920, Albers entered the Bauhaus, a school that was committed to looking into the relationship between arts and technological society, really emphasizing the structural differences of architecture, fine art, and craft. During Albers time at the Bauhaus, he studied as a maker of stained glass and in 1922 he was charged with running the Bauhaus glass workshop. In addition to working in glass and metal, he also designed furniture and typography.</p>

			<p>After the Nazis forced the Bauhaus to close in 1933, the architect Philip Johnson, offered positions to Albers and his wife Anni Albers, at the experimental art school, Black Mountain College, where he headed the painting program from 1933 to 1949.</p>

			<p>Black Mountain Collage was a liberal art college with a very innovative and progressive core curriculum, and Albers’s preliminary art course in materials and form was one of only two courses required for all of the students to take, regardless of their major’s. Albers brought many of his theories and teaching methods of the Bauhaus to Black Mountain. Furthermore, in addition to painting, printmaking, murals, and architectural commissions, Albers published poetry, articles, and books on art theory. His most successful book, Interaction of Color, was and is widely used text in art education and has recently been reissued by Yale University.</p>
