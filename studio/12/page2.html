			<p>KEY IDEAS</p>
			<p>Albers' 1963 book Interaction of Color provided analysis of the function and perception of color to date, and influenced art education and artistic practice in the twentieth century.</p>
			<p>His series Homage to the Square, produced from 1949 until his death, used a single geometric shape that explored the vast range of visual effects that could be achieved through color and spatial relationships alone.</p>
			<p>Albers' art and theories were widely shared to generations of artists and art-school faculty through his teachings at the Bauhaus, Black Mountain College, and Yale University, as they provided knowledge and development of non-objective art during and after the age of Abstract Expressionism.</p>
