<h2>Birth of the User // Smalltalk</h2>
</div>

<div class="text">
	<b>What can we learn from this letter about the user experience?</b>
	<p>It told us that this interaction was very new for the user. The system of using a device (mouse) to click on an icon in order to have a brush to draw with is what she described as fairly complicated. However she understood it and knew how to use it.</p> 

	<b>How extendable was the system?</b>
	<p>It seems that once she learned how to use SmallTalk, she was able, with another user, to create a new program. She learned how to make the shapes follow the mouse, and created a painting program.</p>


	<b>Can you highlight the points in which the user was on-board?</b>
	<p>Learning how to start the computer, draw and manipulate rectangles, clicking to select, clicking to draw.
