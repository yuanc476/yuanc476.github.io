			<h2>Design for the Elderly</h2>
		</div>
		<div id="text">
			<p>Design for the elderly is not a prominent or popular aspect of UI and UX design. However, the population of 65+ year olds is not negligible, and is only going to increase in the coming years. The National Institute on Aging (NIH) says, "In 2010, an estimated 524 million people were aged 65 or older—8 percent of the world’s population. By 2050, this number is expected to nearly triple to about 1.5 billion, representing 16 percent of the world’s population."</p>
			<p> I first looked into the technical requirements that accompany age. What I found was:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>sight and hearing: customizable font size and high contrast help weaker eyesight. Adjustable sound levels and subtitles to videos or podcasts are also helpful for hearing difficulties.</li>
				<li>touchscreens vs. mouse: the motor functions needed for manipulating a mouse deteriorate earlier than those needed to use a touchscreen.</li>
				<li>navigation: larger buttons with adequate spacing facilitates the user experience. Limiting the steps to an action to a lower number is also helpful.</li>
				<li>walkthrough: clear instructions on how to use a website or app should be available for the first use as well as on demand since users may need reminders. Be explicit but do not undermine the more experienced users.</li>
				<li>icons: one cannot assume that users understand all icons or navigation tools such as scroll bars.</li>
			</ul>
			<p> I then looked into what users would be interested in:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Social interaction and communication: the elderly usually have smaller, more trusted circle of friends and family. Applications and websites that encourage social activity can help loneliness.</li>
				<li>Health: health-related websites and forums can be made more accessible through interaction design. Instant communication with doctors can reduce stress.</li>
				<li>Reminders: weaker memories can be helped with reminders to take medicine at the right time, or for other tasks.</li>
				<li>Entertainment: with much free time, entertainment in the form of news, movies, TV shows, or games are welcomed.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This led me to wonder about what design for the elderly would be like in the future. Since it is difficult to know what new technology will be available by the time my generation will be old, I speculated more for my parents' generation. Most will already know how to navigate the average application or website, so there would be less of a learning curve and more willingness to use them. I believe there will be more online activity such as online shopping, lessons (for hobbies), photo and social sharing (albeit with a smaller audience than with younger groups). Developments in wearables would allow for more accurate and reliable health trackers, and AI could possibly reduce the need for physical meetings with doctors.</p>
			<p>There is much room for advances in interactive design for the elderly, and I believe that with an increasing old population, many advances will be made.</p>
