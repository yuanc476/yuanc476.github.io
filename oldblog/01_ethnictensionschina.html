	<div class="text">
		<p>There are 56 ethnic groups in China, with almost 92% of the population being Han. I had heard vaguely of clashes and conflicts between minorities and the Chinese (mainly Han) government, but had not looked much into it.</p>

		<p>The first time I had heard of it was when tensions were rising in Tibet. Tibet is under Chinese government as an autonomous region, but the population there has very different customs and cultures compared to the Han. According to the Tibetans, the Chinese government limits their freedom of worship and expression, and discourages their culture. In 1995, the Panchen Lama (an important figure in Tibetan Buddhism), Gendhun Choekyi Nyima, was detained by the Chinese government at age 6. Very little information has been released about him since. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-32771242">(1)</a> The Chinese government, however, consider their rule positive with the creation of infrastructure such as railroads and the industry growth.</p>

		<p>The disagreements over Tibet's status are not recent ones. According to China, Tibet has been part of the country since the 13th century and thus should continue that way. Tibet disagrees, pointing to Tibet's declaration of independence in 1912, until China sent troops in 1950 to solidify Beijing's claims in what Tibetans call colonization. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-14533879">(2)</a> There has been unrest and protests of Beijing's rule in Tibet and neighboring provinces where Tibetan populations are significant. The self-immolation of monks has made headlines worldwide. In 1959, an uprising started in Lhasa when fears that the Dalai Lama would be kidnapped were sparked by a suspicious invitation by the Chinese government. The Dalai Lama fled to India and set up a goverment in exile, and the uprising was suppressed.<a href="http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/rebellion-in-tibet">(3)</a></p>

		<p>Another significant conflict in China is happening in Xinjiang, another autonomous region in the North-West of China. The province is mainly populated by the Uighur, although a large influx of Han people in recent years has almost made the Uighur a minority. As with Tibet, the Uighur have a very different culture from the Han: most practice Islam, and they view themselves closer to Central Asian populations. According to the native population, the Beijing government has suppressed their religious, cultural, and economic practices. For example, fasting during Ramadan has been restricted for several periods over time. Large projects in the cities have brought many qualified Han people, to whom many of the jobs go, causing discontent and resentment in the local population. They also accuse the government of exaggerating the conflict as an excuse for increased repression. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-22278037">(4)</a> According to the Beijing government, Uighur separatists are planning violent protests and sabotage, and have labeled them as auxiliaries of al-Qaeda with little evidence.</p>

		<p>In 2009, a large ethnic riot occured in Urumqi, leading to almost 200 deaths. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-26414014">(5)</a> According to officials, most were Han. The conflict was one of the reasons Facebook was banned in China, as the government feared resistance was organized on the platform. Several smaller attacks on Han people have happened, including a massacre in 2015 in which more than 50 people were killed (majority were Han). More forces were sent to find the attackers, but little information was given to the public. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/19/world/asia/in-a-region-disturbed-by-ethnic-tensions-china-keeps-tight-lid-on-a-massacre.html">(6)</a> Acts of violence have not been reported much on in China. <a href="https://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/26/deadly-attacks-in-xinjiang-go-unreported-in-china/?_r=0">(7)</a></p>
